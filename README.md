# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

This repository contains a simple calendar app for scheduling your work day. Current day is displayed at the top of the calendar and timeblocks for standard business hours displayed below. Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past(gray), present(red), or future(green). You are able to add and remove events to the timeblock in local storage.
